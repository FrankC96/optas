** TODO [#C] Handle linear constraints 

The =OptimizationBuilder= class should have additional containers for linear constraints.
Scipy can handle linear constraints, but these need to be defined explicitly.
Currently, I just pass all constraints as generic nonlinear constraints.
This update would likely lead to speedups.
